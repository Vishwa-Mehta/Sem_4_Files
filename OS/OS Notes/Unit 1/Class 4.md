### Computer System Architecture:
- most systems use a single general purpose processor
- device specific processors run on a limited no. of instructions
- processsors are managed by the OS
- Disk controller microprocessor:
	- impelments it's own disk queue and scheduling algorithm
	- relieves overhead of scheduing from CPU
	- these are low-level components
	-  Multiprocessors:
		- Parallel systems or tightly coupled systems
		- Increased throughput
		- Economy of scale
		- increase reliability
			- loosely coupled system: memory is distributed
			- tightly coupled system: memory is shared
			-
