### Methods for handling deadlock:
- 2 ways:
	- allow system to **enter deadlock** -> detect -> recover
	- **ignore** the problem and pretend that deadlocks never occur in the system
- conditions for deadlock to occur:
	- mutual exclusion
		- atleast on resource should be non-sharable
		- sharable resources do not require mutual exclusion
	- hold and wait
		- ensures that a process doesn't hold a resource when it asks for another resource
		- low resrc utilisation and can cause starvation
	- no preemption
