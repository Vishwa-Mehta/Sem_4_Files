### Memory Protection:
- Protection of the OS from access by user processes
- Protection is provided by the hardware
- A pair of **base register** and **limit register**:
	- base: starting address
	- limit: defines the no. of bytes allocated in the space
- CPU checks whether the the address generated in the user mode lies in the specified range
- If it falls outside the range then it leads to a **trap state** to the OS -> flags it as a memory access violation (fatal error)
- The base and limit registers are only loaded by the OS using **privileged instr** 
	- these instructions can only be executed in the kernel mode.
	- only OS can change the reg values -> prevents user prog from modifying the values


### Address Binding:
- Addresses in the source program are *symbolic* (ex: variable names and data types)
- The compiler *binds* these **symbolic addresses** to **logical addresses** which are also known as **re-locatable addresses** 
	- Ex: 14 bytes from beginning of the module (relative?)
- The linkage editor or the **loader** binds the **logical addresses** to **physical addresses**
	- Ex: specific address value like 60014 if 6000 was the address of the beginning of the module
- Each of these bindings are a mapping between 2 address spaces.
- Base register mapping scheme:
	- base reg aka reloaction reg
	- execution time binding occurs when reference to memory location is made
- This process of binding can be done at:
	1. Compile time binding:
		- If the **starting location** of the process is known at **compile time**, then **absolute addresses** can be generated at compile time.
		- If the starting address changes, then the program will have to be recompiled.
	2. Load time:
		- If we don't know the exact location of process in memory then the compiler generates a **re-locatable (logical) address**.
		- These logical addresses can be bound to physical (ie. absolute) addresses when the program is loaded into the memory. 
		- If the starting address changes, then the program only has to be reloaded into the new address.
	3. Execution time/ Run time:
		- If the process may be moved from one memory segment to another during its execution, then the binding must take place only at run time.
		- This is the most commonly used method in modern OSes as it allows more efficient memory usage.
