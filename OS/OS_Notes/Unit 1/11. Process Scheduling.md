- processes commonly alternate between periods of heavy CPU activity (a CPU burst) and periods of high I/O activity (an I/O burst)
- frequency of I/O bursts and CPU bursts is imp in choosing scheduling algorithm

#### Types of Scheduling:
- 2 types:
	1. **Preemptive**:
		- running -> ready : interrupt
		- waiting -> ready : I/O to CPU
		- can lead to race conditions -> **mutex locks** prevent this while accessing shared data from kernel DS
		- can affect kernel design
	2. **Non preemptive**:
		- running -> waiting : CPU to I/O or memory access or wait()
		- process terminates
		- once a process is allocated the CPU, it takes control of the CPU until it has to wait or it terminates. 
- **dispatcher** gives control fo CPU tp process selected by the short-term scheduler
	- invokes a context-switch -> switch to user mode -> jump to location in user program and start execution
	- time taken for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another is called the **dispatch latency**
	- invoked by every process

#### Scheduling Criteria:
- **CPU Utilization:** The fraction of time the CPU is kept busy. 40-90 % max
- **Throughput:** Number of processes completed per unit time
- **Turnaround time:** Interval between process submission and process completion. 
	- amount of time to execute a particular process
- **Waiting time:**  amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue
	- Sum of all time periods spent by process in the wait queue
- **Response Time:** Time between process submission and first response. 
- **optimisation criteria:**
	- MAX : CPU utilization, Throughput
	- MIN: turnaround time(TAT), Waiting time, Response Time

#### Scheduling Algorithms:
1. **First Come First Serve: (FCFS)**
	- The effect of a long process in front of many short processes, making the short processes wait for CPU time, is called the **convoy effect**
	- Non preemptive
2. **Shortest Job First: (SJF)**
	- shortest burst time first
	- τ<sub>n</sub>+1 = αt<sub>n</sub>+ (1 − α)τ<sub>n</sub>
		- τ<sub>i</sub> : predicted burst time
		- t<sub>i</sub> : actual burst time
		- α : constant value that's < 1 -> 0.5 generally
3. **Shortest Remaining Time First: (SRTF) / Preemptive SJF**
	- the process with the shortest CPU burst time is chosen, and the current process is pre-empted in its place.
4. **Priority Scheduling:**
	- Low priority processes may be blocked from CPU access by a steady stream of high priority processes arriving constantly. This problem is called **starvation**.
	- resolved by a process called **aging**, wherein the priority of a waiting process is increased after fixed intervals of time.
5. **Round Robin Scheduling: (RR)**
	- The fundamental unit of time in an RRS algorithm is called the **time slice** or **time quantum** (denoted as *q*)
	- very small q -> large overheads due to frequent context switching
	- large value of q -> RRS algorithm becomes a FCFS system instead
6. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling:**
	- process classified into groups -> foreground (interactive) and background (batch processes)
	- each grp has different scheduling requirements
	- ready is partitioned into smaller queues with their own algo and associated properties
	- process is assigned to queue based on some property like memory size, process priority, or process type
	- priority is also there within queues
	- time slice can also be put on queues
7. **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:**
	- This allows processes to move between all the various process queues, with the intent of separating processes according to their CPU burst times.
	- too much CPU time -> process moved to lower priority queue
	- aging is implemented to prevent starvation by moving process to higher priority queue
	- categorised by:
		- no. of queues and their scheduling algos
		- method to promote and demote process from one queue to another
		- method to determine queue for the new incoming processes
