- Soft:
	- They guarantee only that the process will be given preference over noncritical processes.
	- no guarantee as to **when** a critical real-time process will be scheduled
- Hard:
	- A task must be serviced by its deadline
	- service after the deadline has expired is the same as no service at all
- 2 types of delays to be minimised:
	- Interrupt latency: interval b/w interrupt arrival at CPU and start of it's ISR
		- finish current instr
		- save process state
		- switch context to ISR
	- Dispatch latency: time needed to stop one process anf schedule next one in ready queue
		- minimised using preemptive scheduling

#### Priority Scheduling:
- preemptive
- soft real time
- PCU required at constant intervals
- 0 <= processing <= deadline <= period
- rate of periodic task = 1/p (p->period)

#### Rate monotonic Scheduling:
- static priority scheduling
- priority assigned basesd on 1/p
- short p = high priority
- long p = low priority

#### Earliest Deadline First Scheduling (EDF):
- priorities assigned based on deadline
	- early deadline -> higher priority
	- later deadline -> lower priority
- process must annouce deadline before it becomes runnable

#### Proportional Share Scheduling:
- T shares allocated among all processes
- each process : N/T of processor time (N shares)

#### POSIX real-time Scheduling:
- provides api for managing real-time threads
- SCHED_FIFO : FCFS, no time slicing
- SCHED_RR : FCFS with time slicing for equal priority threads
- 2 functions:
```C
pthread_attr_getsched_policy(pthread_attr_t *attr, int *policy)
pthread_attr_setsched_policy(pthread_attr_t *attr, int policy)
```
