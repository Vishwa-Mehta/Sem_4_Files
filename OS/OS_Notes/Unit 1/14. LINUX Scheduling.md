#### Pre v2.5:
- Before Linux 2.5, a variant of the UNIX scheduler was used.
- not built with SMP (symmetric multiprocessing) systems in mind

#### v2.5-v2.6.22:
- O(1) scheduler, named because of its constant time complexity
- maintains arrays of active and expired processes
- Each process is given a fixed time quantum, after which it is preempted and moved to the expired array
- active array empty -> expired becomes new active array
- did not suit the interactive processes that run on desktop systems

#### v2.6.23+:
- **Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)** is the default Linux scheduling algorithm for versions
2.6.23 and beyond of Linux.
- based on **priority classes**, with each class assigned a certain priority
- standard kernel implements two classes :
	- based on the CFS
	- other one for real-time processes
- proportion of CPU time alloted to each process is based on the calculated **nice value** of that process (between **-20 to +19**) 
	- bigger nice value -> lower priority
- CFS doesn’t use discrete values of time slices
- The CFS uses the vruntime (virtual runtime) variable -> store how much time process is running for
- Real-time processes are assigned priorities between 0 and 99, while normal tasks are assigned priorities from 100 to 139.
- Normal tasks are assigned a priority based on their nice values, where a value of –20 maps to priority 100 and a nice value of +19 maps to 139.
