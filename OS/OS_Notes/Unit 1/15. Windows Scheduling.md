- Priority based preemptive scheduling algorithm.
- The **dispatcher** is the portion of the Windows kernel that schedules processes.
- 32 priority classes -> divided into 2:
	- **Variable classes**: priority 1-15
	- **real-time classes**: priority 16-31
	- thread 0: memory management thread
- no ready threads -> dispatcher sneds **idle thread**
- The 6 main subclasses according to the Windows API are:
	- IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS
	- BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
	- NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
	- ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_ CLASS
	- HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS
	- REAL-TIME_PRIORITY_CLASS : **no variable priority**
- User-mode scheduling introduced in Windows 7 allows user applications to create and manage threads independently of the kernel.
- Microsoftâ€™s ConcRT runtime library for C++ allows user-mode scheduling, user apps to create and manage threads, as well as methods to divide applications into parallelizable tasks.
