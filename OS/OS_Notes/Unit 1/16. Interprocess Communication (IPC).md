#### Processes:
- Independent: don't affect each other
- Co-operating: affect each other
	- info sharing
	- computation speed up - divide tasks
	- modularity
	- convinience
	- need IPC

#### 2 communication models of IPC:
- message passing
- shared memory

#### Producer-Consumer Problem:
- unbounded-buffer : Consumer may have to wait for new items, but the producer can always produce new items
- bounded-buffer : **Consumer** must wait if the buffer is **empty**; **producer** must wait if the buffer is **full**.
- implemented as **circular queue**
```C
#Producer
item next_produced;
while (true) {
	/* produce an item in next_produced */
	while (((in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE) == out); /* do nothing */
	buffer[in] = next_produced;
	in = (in + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
}
```
```C
#Consumer
item next_consumed;
while (true) {
	while (in == out); /* do nothing */
	next_consumed = buffer[out];
	out = (out + 1) % BUFFER_SIZE;
	/* consume the item in next_consumed */
}
```

#### Shared Memory:
- two or more processes have access to same memory
- fastest form of IPC
- OS normally prevents processes from writing into each otherâ€™s dedicated memory -> for shared memory IPC this restriction is temporarily removed -> if both processes agree
- processes control format of data as well as coherency issue
- major issue -> mechanism to for synchronising actions -> semaphores used

#### Message Passing:
- Allows processes to communicate without sharing a common address space -> distributed systems -> process connected over a network
- Every Message Passing interface must provide a  **send(message)** and a **receive(message)** function.
- message size can be constant or variable

#### Communication:
- **direct:**
	- processes refer to each other explicitly when sending messages.
	- must know each other's identity
	- link is established -> each link associated with exactly 2 processes
	- may be symmetric or asymmetric
	- not desirable
- **indirect:**
	- messages are sent to and received from *mailboxes* or *ports*
	- only if processes share a mailbox, they can communicate
	- each pair may have several links and each link can connect several process
	- link : uni or bidirectional

#### Synchronisation:
- **blocking send:** sending process -> blocked till message being sent is received and read by receiving process/mailbox
- **non-blocking send:** Sending process can send a message and resume operation.
- **blocking recieve:** The receiver process blocks itself until a message arrives.
- **non-blocking recieve:** The receiver retrieves either a valid message or a NULL message.
- **both** send and recieve are **blocking** -> **rendezvous** b/w 2 processes -> solution to producer-consumer problem made trivial
```C
#producer:
message next_produced;
while (true) {
	/* produce an item in next_produced */
	send(next_produced);
}
```
```C
#consumer:
message next_consumed;
while (true) {
	receive(next_consumed);
	/* consume the item in next_consumed */
}
```
#### Buffering:
- queues of messages attached to link (temporary queue)
- implementation:
	- zero capacity: no messages are queued on a link -> sender must wait for rendezvous
	- bounded capacity: finite length of n messages -> sender must wait if full
	- inbounded capacity: infinite length -> sender never waits
- zero-capacity case is sometimes referred to as a message system with no buffering

#### Pipes:
- simplest form of IPC
- half duplex IPC
- 2 types:
	- Ordinary (Unnamed) Pipes:
		- cannot be accessed from outside the process that created it.
		- parent creates pipe to communicate with child
		- producer-consumer style (write-read)
		- half-duplex (unidirectional)
	- Named Pipes: can be accessed without a parent-child relationship
		- More powerful than ordinary pipes
		- bidirectional
		- several processes in same pipe
		- 2 pipes for 2 way
