### Computer System Organisation
- A computer consists of hardware resources which are to be managed by the OS
- CPU(s) and device controllers have access to shared memory via a common bus
- Each device controller is in charge of particular device type and has local memory
- Device controller sends interrupt to CPU when task is completed.
- CPU(s) and data controllers compete for **memory cycles** and can run concurrently
- **Memory controller** is provided to synchronise access to memory

#### Bootstrap:
- It is the first program to be executed when the system is booted
- stored in ROM
- aka **firmware**
- initialises all aspects of the system - CPU regs, IO devices, etc.
- Loads OS kernel onto the main memory
- First program created is called **init** waits for an event to occur (interrput)

#### Interrupts:
- An OS is interrupt driven
- An event occurrence is defined by a signal known as an **interrupt**.
- Interrupt is provided by the peripheral devices to the CPU
- Interrupt transfers control to -> Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) via -> the Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) -> contains the addresses of all the service routines
- **Interrupt Handling**
	- Storing the current PC and register values before interrupt was received by CPU
	- 2 methods: (same as MPCA)
		1. Polling: 
			- Read the state (busy/available) of each I/O device in a list and then service the one who makes a request.
			- Repeat continuously while CPU has power.
		2. Vectored Interrupts:
			- The device notifies the CPU that it needs attention. 
			- The CPU reads the address of the appropriate ISR from the IVT and pauses the current program execution to handle the ISR.

#### Storage:
- Main Memory: 
	- CPU can access directly
	- volatile
	- random access
	- DRAM in computers
	- EEPROMs in mobile phones
- Secondary Memory: 
	- non-volatile
	- large capacity
	- permanent storage of data and programs
	- Hard disks:
		- disk -> tracks -> sectors
		- disk controller is used to interact b/w device and computer
	- SSD:
		- faster than Hard disks 
- Cache:
	- caching: copying information into faster storage system
	- to access info faster
- Registers
- Device drivers:
	- for managing each IO device
	- uniform interface b/w kernel and controller

Memory hierarchy:
(in order of increasing size/decreasing cost/decreasing speed)
register -> cache -> main memory -> ssd -> hard disk -> optical disk -> magnetic tapes

#### I/O Structure:
1. After I/O starts control returns to user program only after completion of I/O:
	- CPU idles until next interrupt given (wait instruction)
	- No simultaneous yo processing can occur
2. After I/O starts control returns to user program without waiting for I/O completion:
	- system call : request to OS to allow user to wait for I/O completion
	- Device-status table: contains entry for each I/O device indicating its type, address, and state
	- OS indexes into I/O device table to determine device status and to modify table entry to include interrupt

#### DMA Structure:
- used for high speed I/O devices
- device controller transfers data directly from device to main memory without CPU intervention
- only one interrupt generated **per block** rather than per byte
