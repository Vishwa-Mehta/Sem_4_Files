### Computer System Architecutre:
#### Single processor:
- A single general-purpose CPU executes a general-purpose instruction set, including instructions from user processes.
- May contain **special purpose** processors like disk, keyboard, graphic controller
	- run a limited amt of instructions
- managed and monitored by OS

#### Multiprocessor:
- aka **parallel systems/tightly-coupled systems**
- Advantages:
	-  increased throughput
	- economy of scale
	- increased reliability
- graceful degradation:
	- faliure of hardware -> only proportional drop in performance
- fault tolerant: 
	- faliure of a component -> continued operation 
	- this kind of system needs faliure detection, diagnosis, and correction
- 2 types:
	1. Asymmetric multiprocessing:
		- each processor -> specific task
		- no shared memory
	2. Symmetric multiprocessing: 
		- each processor -> all tasks
		- shared memory
- **DUAL core:**
	- multi core, multi chip
	- systems containing all chips ; chassis containing multiple separate systems
- All multicore systems are multiprocessor systems, but all multiprocessor systems are not multicorem systems.
- **Blade servers:**
	- systems in which multiple processor boards, I/O boards, and networking boards are placed in the same chassis
	- board boots independently and runs its own OS
	- some are multiprocessors as well
	- multiple independent multiprocessor systems

#### Clustered Systems:
- Multiple systems working together (over a network)
- Storage shared using -> Storage Area Network (SAN)
- High availability service
- Survives faliures
- 2 types:
	- Asymmetric -> 1 machine in hot standby mode takes over in case of faliure
	- Symmetric -> multiple nodes running app monitoring each other
- some are for High Performance Computing (HPC)
- may have distributed lock manager (DLM) -> avoid shared data conflicts
