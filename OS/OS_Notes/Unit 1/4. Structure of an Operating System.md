#### Multiprogramming:
- aka **batch system**
- needed for efficiency
- one user cant keep CPU busy all the time
- paradigm that allows the CPU to always have atleast one job to do (in terms of either I/O device handling or user program handling)
- working:
	- OS -> maintains job pool of all processes on disk -> picks a job (job 1) -> begins execution
	- jobs in main mem are subset of this job pool
	- if job 1 waits (for an I/O operation) -> OS swiches to job 2 and executes instead of sitting idle
	- when job 2 waits again OS switches to new job and so on..
	- when job 1 finishes waiting -> CPU takes back the control
	- this way CPU is never idle
- these systems only handle hardware usage not user interaction with the hardware

#### Multitasking (Time sharing):
- extension of multiprogramming -> CPU switches between jobs at a very fast rate and more frequently
- allows multiple users to access a single computer
- choosing which job to do is the task of **job scheduling algorithms**
- to ensure reasonable response time **swapping** is done -> swap process in and out of main memory
- another method is using virtual memory
	- enables users to run programs that are larger than actual physical memory
	- abstracts main memory into a large, uniform array of storage, separating logical memory as viewed by the user from physical memory.
- these OSes provide:
	-  file system
	- disk managemetn
	- resource protection mechanism
	- job sync and communication to prevent deadlock
