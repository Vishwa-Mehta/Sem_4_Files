- Interrupt driven:
	- Hardware: by some device
	- Software:
		- software error - div by 0
		- request for os service
		- infinite loop, process modifying each other or the OS

#### Dual mode and Multi mode Operation of an OS:
1. Dual mode:
	- allows OS to protect itself and other system components
	- 2 modes:
		- **user mode**
		- **kernel mode**
	- mode bit:
		- used to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code
		- privilaged instructtions only executable in kernel mode
		- system calls change mode to kernel and return resets it to user mode
2. Multi mode:
	- VM manager mode for VMs
	- The VMM (Virtual Machine Management) is at a privilege level above the user but below the kernel, which is needed to change the CPU state while creating virtual machines.
- Transition from User -> Kernel mode:
	- on an interrupt hardware switches from user -> kernel mode (mode bit = 0)
	- request is fulfilled -> switch back before passign control to user program
- **System Timer**:
	- used to prevent infinite loop/process hogging resources
	- OS sets the counter
	- used to terminate the program if it takes too long 
	- Variable timers are implemented using the system clock in combination with a down counter.

#### Kernel DS:
- Arrays
- LL
	- SLL
	- DLL
	- CLL
- Stack
- Trees
- Hash Functions and Maps
- Bitmap
