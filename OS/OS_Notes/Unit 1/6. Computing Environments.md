#### Traditional:
- Stand-alone general purpose machines
- Portals: provide web access to internal systems
- Mobile computers interconnect via wireless networks
- eg: company servers

#### Mobile:
- Handheld smartphones, tablets, etc
- Extra feature â€“ more OS features (GPS, gyroscope)
- Allows new types of apps like augmented reality
- Use IEEE 802.11 wireless, or cellular data networks for connectivity
- eg. Android, iOS

#### Distributed:
- Collection of separate, possibly heterogeneous, systems networked together
	- LAN
	- WAN
	- MAN
	- PAN
- Network Operating Systems:
	- Communication scheme allows systems to exchange messages
	- Illusion of a single system

#### Client-Server:
- servers respond to client requests
	- Compute-server system: provides an interface to client to request services (i.e., database)
	- File-server system: provides interface for clients to store and retrieve files

#### Peer-to-Peer:
- Another model of distributed system
- does not distinguish clients and servers
- all nodes are considered peers
- ex: VoIP, Napster, Gnutella

#### Virtualisation:
- Allows operating systems to run applications within other OSes
- host OS runs guest OS as application
- source CPU diff from target CPU --- emulation
- OS natively compiled for CPU running guest OSes also natively compiled --- virtualisation

#### Cloud Computing:
- Delivers **computing**, **storage**, even **apps** as a service across a network
- Logical extension of virtualization
- Types:
	- public
	- private
	- hybrid
- SaaS - Software (eg: word processor)
- PaaS - Platform (eg: database server -software stack)
- IaaS - Infrastructure (eg: storage available for backup)

#### Real time Embedded:
- most prevalent form of computers
- vary considerable, special purpose, limited purpose OS, real-time OS
- special computing environments as well
	- some have OS some perform tasks without OS also
- Has well-defined fixed time constraints
	- Processing must be done within constraint 
	- Correct operation only if constraints met
