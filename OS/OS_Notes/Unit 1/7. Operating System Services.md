#### Functions helpful to the user:
- User Interface:
	- CLI
	- GUI
- Program Execution:
	- system must be able to load a program into memory and to run that program, end execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error)
- I/O operations: A running program may require I/O, which may involve a file or an I/O device
- File-system manipulation: Programs need to read and write files and directories, create and delete them, search them, list file Information, permission management.
- Communications:
	- may be via shared memory or through message passing (packets moved by the OS)
- Error detection:
	- CPU/Memory errors, I/O device errors, user errors. Take appropriate action as per error type, and ensure correct and consistent computing.

#### Functions helpful to the system:
- Resource allocation:
	- when multiple processes are running resources must be allocated to each of them
- Accounting: keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computer resources 
- Protection and security: to control use of that information, concurrent processes should not interfere with each other
	- **Protection** involves ensuring that all access to system resources is controlled
	- **Security** of the system from outsiders requires user authentication, extends to defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts
