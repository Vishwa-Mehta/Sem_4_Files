#### Policy and Mechanism:
- User goals and System goals
	- User goals - should be convenient to use, easy to learn, reliable, safe, and fast
	- System goals - hould be easy to design, implement, and maintain, as well as flexible, reliable, error-free, and efficient
- policy : what to do
- mechanism : how to do
- separation of policy and mechanism imp -> gives flexibilty

#### Implementation:
- Assembly lang -> system programming languages like Algol, PL/1 -> Now C, C++
- usually a mix of languages:
	- lowest level - assembly
	- main body - C
	- system programs - C, C++, scripting langs -> Perl, Python, Shell script
- high level lang -> easier to port , but slower
- Emulation can allow an OS to run on non-native hardware
